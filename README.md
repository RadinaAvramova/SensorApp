# Sensor App
Welcome to the SensorApp project! This Kotlin application provides a platform for monitoring and interacting with various sensors available on mobile devices. With SensorApp, users can access sensor data, perform sensor calibration, and develop sensor-based applications.

## Features
1. **Sensor Data Display:** Displays real-time data from various sensors, including accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, and more.

2. **Sensor Fusion:** Implements sensor fusion algorithms to combine data from multiple sensors for more accurate and reliable measurements.

3. **Sensor Calibration:** Provides tools for calibrating sensors to improve accuracy and reduce errors in sensor readings.

4. **Data Logging:** Enables users to log sensor data to a file for later analysis or processing.

5. **Sensor Control:** Allows users to control sensor settings, such as sampling rate, sensitivity, and filtering options.

6. **Sensor Visualization:** Visualizes sensor data through graphs, charts, or other graphical representations to facilitate data interpretation.

## Installation
To run the SensorApp on your Android device, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/SensorApp.git

2. **Open in Android Studio:** Open the project in Android Studio IDE.

3. **Build and Run:** Build the project and run it on your connected Android device or emulator.

## Usage
1. **Launch the App:** Open the SensorApp on your Android device.

2. **Select Sensors:** Choose which sensors you want to monitor from the list of available sensors.

3. **View Sensor Data:** View real-time sensor data on the screen, including numerical values, graphs, or other visual representations.

4. **Calibrate Sensors:** If necessary, calibrate sensors using the calibration tools provided in the app.

5. **Log Sensor Data:** Optionally, log sensor data to a file for further analysis or processing.

6. **Control Sensor Settings:** Adjust sensor settings such as sampling rate, sensitivity, or filtering options to customize the sensor behavior.

## Customization
1. **Add New Sensors:** Extend the app by adding support for additional sensors available on the device or external sensors connected via Bluetooth or other interfaces.

2. **Customize User Interface:** Modify the user interface to improve usability, add new features, or enhance the visual representation of sensor data.

3. **Implement Advanced Features:** Implement advanced features such as sensor fusion algorithms, sensor data processing, or integration with machine learning models for sensor data analysis.
